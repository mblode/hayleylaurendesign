Modern Lace is an interactive three-dimensional crocheted length that reinterprets traditional lace techniques in a contemporary way. It focuses on continuously changing patterned shadows, created through its relationship with light. It adopts a kaleidoscope effect as when the light moves the shadow changes and different patterns are created.

Using a torch, the viewers able to control the movement and scale of the shadow. It responds to themes such as ‘Reinterpreting traditional techniques’ and ‘Interactive textiles,’ as it engages the viewer and makes them apart of the work.

The selection of wire is integral to the structural process and allows for the formation of three-dimensional web-like designs and the interplay of positive and negative space.  The contrast of thick and thin yarn is used to emphasize areas resulting in the appearance of floating patterned shadows that can be moved and manipulated through light.

It is the relationship between the viewer and the crochet, which reinterprets the traditional technique and brings it into the contemporary world creating Modern Lace.
